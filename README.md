# Burger Saving App w/ Handlebars!

This application was made to take user input, store it in the data base, and display it on the front end for the user to see. Users can enter in any name of a burger they would like to eat, and it will display in a list called "Burgers To Eat" below. Once the user eats said burger, they are able to click a button, "Ate it" which will then move the chosen burger to a list called "Burgers Eaten."

This project was my first full stack application! It was also my first expierence wokring with Handlebars. I am used to single JS file, along with an HTML and CSS. This has multiple, multiple files, which took a minute to get used to!
